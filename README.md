# Stock Price Prediction using Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis- Time series analysis project

## The purpose of this project is to  forecast the  Netflix stock price for a particular time period and also to analyze the sentiment of the company (here Netflix) by scraping review data about Netflix on Reddit and performing sentiment analysis on it using finBERT model. 
## This sentiment can give a quick look to the user whether or not to invest in Netflix stocks based on its sentiment currently. This feature makes the application novel as the data is streamlined and can be continuously updated with time. 
## Based on the visualizations of the predictions, we selected  LSTM model as it is best suited for our data and gives better results. This app targets users who want to invest in a particular stock by providing them with predictions of the stock price and 
## provide them with knowledge of previous stock rates and the way they fluctuate depending on the market.
